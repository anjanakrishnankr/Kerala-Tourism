    <p>A cluster of scenic islands, beautiful hills and rare avian species would intrigue and entice every birdwatcher on the planet. This is exactly what the Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary has to offer its visitors. One is greeted by the Kadalundi River flowing into the Arabian Sea while migratory birds casually flit about.</p>

    <p>Known as the ‘Ooty of Malappuram’, the hilly area is a top-rated weekend destination in north Kerala. The British hoisted their flag on this hilltop during a survey and hence the place got its name. Located 10 km from Perinthalmanna town, Kodikuthimala is the highest point in the Amminikandan range of hills. Apart from the ever-flowing springs and waterfalls, a watchtower and a suicide point are the main attractions at the hill station.
