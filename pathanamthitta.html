    <p>Konni is a land of forests, plantations, wild animals etc and the Elephant Training center, Achankovil River etc made Konni popular in the tourist map. Last month I have been to Konni and being the end of monsoon, the river was having sufficient water and it rained heavily in the evening and night. Though we traveled through the forest and my friend and son who were with me wanted to go for a Kutta Vanchi sailing in Adavi Eco Tourism area, the climate was not favorable. We went to Kattathipara which is a popular tourist destination near Konni and is famous for the huge rock formation. </p>

    <p>Located on the Western Ghats of the Sahyadri Range, Perunthenaruvi is famous for the waterfalls there. The waterfalls are known for their wide area, rather than their height. It is located in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala state. The stream later unites with the Pamba River.</p>
